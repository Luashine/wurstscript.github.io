WurstScript and its related tools require Java to run. Please install or verify your installation.

### Download JRE

[*&nbsp;*{: .fa .fa-download} Download Java from Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk11){: .btn .btn-orange}

Download the Java Runtime appropriate for your system and follow the installation procedure.

Once finished, continue to the next step.

### Verify / Update Java Installation

Many tasks rely on a environment variable called **JAVA_HOME** which might not have been set by the installer.
To verify your installation, open a command prompt and enter `java -version`.

A valid installation will return something like this:

```powershell
> java -version
java version "1.8.0_131"
```

Make sure your minor version `1.8.0_xxx` (xxx) is higher than **101** to avoid any certificate issues.
If it is lower, make sure to update your Java installation, otherwise your connection will be insecure.

If you get an error or get a lower versions displayed, even though you installed a newer one, your **JAVA_HOME** is either missing or configured wrong.

Refer to this [*&nbsp;*{: .fa .fa-external-link-square} Windows tutorial](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/setting-the-java_home-variable-in-windows-8895.html) in order to setup your **JAVA_HOME** correctly.

Once you have setup Java correctly, continue by installing VSCode.
